Data strategies for Bernie Sanders campaign team for DPI321 campaign plan

Please see Sanders Data Targeting Strategy-2.pdf for a report on the data analysis used for campaign targeting. This document helped us determine which states are battleground states, and which are tipping point states using clustering (an unsupervised learning method). Further analysis was then used to determine target counties within these states, and mapping software is used to visualize these decisions. 

All other files are code and data used for the project.
